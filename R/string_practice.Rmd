```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
alarm_report <- data.frame(
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
              date = c("2020-03-14", "2020-03-15", "2020-04-10", "2020-04-18"),
          building = c("Engineering-North",
                       "Bren Hall","Engineering-South","Engr-North"),
     alarm_message = c("10:02am – HVAC system down, facilities management alerted",
                       "8:24am – Elevator North out of service",
                       "12:41am – Fire alarm, UCSB fire responded and cleared",
                       "9:58pm – Campus point emergency siren, UCPD responded")
)
```

### Practice Working with Strings 

```{r}
alarm_report_1 <- alarm_report %>% 
  mutate(building = str_replace(building, pattern = "Engr", replacement = "Engineering")) %>% 
  separate(col = building, into = c("building", "wing"), sep = "-") %>% 
  filter(str_detect(alarm_message, pattern = "responded")) %>% 
  separate(col = alarm_message, into = c("time", "message"), sep = "–") %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::date(date))

class(alarm_report_1$date)
```
